        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Double Cream</li>
            <li>Bacon</li>
            <li>Mushroom</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the Spaghetti in water.</strong> The spaghetti will take the longest out of everything to cook, so start by getting water up to the boil and adding the spaghetti when ready. Make sure to use a large saucepan and add a little salt to the water to give the pasta a bit more flavour and stir regularly until finished to stop sticking. If you don't feel confident doing everything at once, leave this until after step 2 instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Mushroom and Bacon.</strong> Whilst the spaghetti is ongoing, slice up the bacon and mushroom, then add them to a pan of hot olive oil. Fry on a high heat, until they have browned, or until personal taste. Turn off the heat and leave in the pan for later.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the Creamy Egg Sauce.</strong> Crack the eggs into a small bowl, measuring jug with a generous splash of double cream. Add as much salt and pepper as desired and whisk the contents until they have become one creamy sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine Everything together.</strong> Once the spaghetti is ready, drain the water and leave the spaghetti in the pan over a low heat. Pour in the mushroom and bacon and mix it all together. Then, turn off the heat and pour the creamy egg sauce over the top. Stir continuously for 30 seconds to coat everything and serve with grated parmesan on top.</li>
        </ol>
